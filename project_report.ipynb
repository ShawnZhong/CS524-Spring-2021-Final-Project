    "The topic that our team settled on is undergrad course selection at UW Madison. Selecting the appropriate courses for every semester can be a challenging process for some students who aren't certain about the degree structure and numerous requirements. \n",
    "\n",
    "Enrollment variables that are considered are:\n",
    "1. Prerequisites - courses that are required to be completed before enrolling in certain classes\n",
    "2. Semester workload capacity - number of courses taken any given semester cannot exceed a certain number of course credit hours\n",
    "3. Compulsory courses - courses that are required to be taken at some point before graduation\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that students picked their courses for every semester without considering future courses that have strict prerequisites, some of which are compulsory courses, it is very likely that the student will pick a non-optimum route for graduation. For example, a student will not be able to enroll in a compulsory course in a later semester if he/she hasn't taken the prerequisites to that course. As a result, he/she will have to enroll in the prerequisite courses before being able to enroll in the compulsory courses in subsequent semesters, which will delay the student's graduation date. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to find an optimum course selection for each semester in regards to completing the graduation requirements within the shortest period and the least number of courses taken. The optimization technique used in this project is linear and logical optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Should we add these features?**\n",
    "1. Desired courses - \n",
    "Through the interactive console, the student will be able to specify which courses must be included in the plan. \n",
    "2. Limit workload - \n",
    "Through the interactive console, the student will be able to cap the maximum credit for the specified semester. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "The requirements for the undergraduate CS certificate can be found at https://guide.wisc.edu/undergraduate/letters-science/computer-sciences/computer-sciences-ba/#requirementstext. \n",
    "\n",
    "The course list is obtained by web scrapping the course search and enroll website. The list of all relevant courses will be generated in this step. \n",
    "\n",
    "One limitation to our program is that the course prerequisites and compulsory courses have to be manually added through code. "

    "\n",
    "$T$ is the max number of maximum number of semesters (e.g., $T = 8$ means the entire 4-year college).\n",
    "\n",
    "$ t\\in \\{1, \\cdots, T\\}$ stands for a specific semester (e.g., $t = 2$ means the second semester or the Spring semester in the first year).\n",
    "\n",
    "$C$ is the set of classes (e.g., $C = \\{ \\text{CS 200}, \\text{CS 300}, \\text{CS 524}, \\cdots \\}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "$c \\in C$ stands for a specific class (e.g., $c = \\text{CS 524}$)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decision variables\n",
    "\n",
    "$x[t, c]$ is a Boolean variable to denote whether to take the class $c \\in C$ at semester $t \\in \\{1, \\cdots, T\\}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if a student takes CS 524 on the thrid semester, then $x[3, \\text{CS 524}]= 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisite constraint\n",
    "\n",
    "To take the class $c$, students may need to take $c'$ in the previous semesters, we can encode such prerequisite using the following constraint: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$x[t, c] \\le \\sum_{i=1}^{t - 1} x[i, c'] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, CS 524 has the prerequisite similar to \"(CS 200 or 300) and (MATH 340 or 341)\", we can encode it with the constraint:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x[t, \\text{CS 524}] \\le \\sum_{i=1}^{t - 1} x[i, \\text{CS 200}] + \\sum_{i=1}^{t - 1} x[i, \\text{CS 300}] $$\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Graduation requirement\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to meet the graduation requirement, some class $c$ must be taken, so we have the constraint:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum_{t=1}^{T} x[t, c] \\ge 1$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "There are other kinds of graduation requirements, such as taking $k$ coureses from a list of $C$, we can encode such requirements using the following constraint:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\sum_{c \\in C} x[t, c] \\ge k$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Max credits\n",
    "\n",
    "For undergraduate, the number of credits taken in a given semester cannot exceeds a certain number, so we need to ensure that\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum_{c \\in C} x[t, c] \\cdot \\text{credit}(c) \\le \\text{max_credit}, \\quad \\text{for all semester } t$$\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum_{t=1}^{T} x[t, c] \\le 1, \\quad \\text{for all class } c$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective \n",
    "\n",
    "A naive objective would be to minimize the sum of $x$: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\min \\sum_{i=t}^{T} \\sum_{c \\in C} x[t, c]$$\n",
    "\n",
