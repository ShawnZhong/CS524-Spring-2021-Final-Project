    "### Notations\n",
    "\n",
    "$T$ is the max number of maximum number of semesters (e.g., $T = 8$ means the entire 4-year college).\n",
    "\n",
    "$ t\\in \\{1, \\cdots, T\\}$ stands for a specific semester (e.g., $t = 2$ means the second semester or the Spring semester in the first year).\n",
    "\n",
    "$C$ is the set of classes (e.g., $C = \\{ \\text{CS 200}, \\text{CS 300}, \\text{CS 524}, \\cdots \\}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "$c \\in C$ stands for a specific class (e.g., $c = \\text{CS 524}$)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decision variables\n",
    "\n",
    "$x[t, c]$ is a Boolean variable to denote whether to take the class $c \\in C$ at semester $t \\in \\{1, \\cdots, T\\}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if a student takes CS 524 on the thrid semester, then $x[3, \\text{CS 524}]= 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisite constraint\n",
    "\n",
    "To take the class $c$, students may need to take $c'$ in the previous semesters, we can encode such prerequisite using the following constraint: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$x[t, c] \\le \\sum_{i=1}^{t - 1} x[i, c'] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, CS 524 has the prerequisite similar to \"(CS 200 or 300) and (MATH 340 or 341)\", we can encode it with the constraint:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x[t, \\text{CS 524}] \\le \\sum_{i=1}^{t - 1} x[i, \\text{CS 200}] + \\sum_{i=1}^{t - 1} x[i, \\text{CS 300}] $$\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Graduation requirement\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to meet the graduation requirement, some class $c$ must be taken, so we have the constraint:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum_{t=1}^{T} x[t, c] \\ge 1$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "There are other kinds of graduation requirements, such as taking $k$ coureses from a list of $C$, we can encode such requirements using the following constraint:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\sum_{c \\in C} x[t, c] \\ge k$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Max credits\n",
    "\n",
    "For undergraduate, the number of credits taken in a given semester cannot exceeds a certain number, so we need to ensure that\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum_{c \\in C} x[t, c] \\cdot \\text{credit}(c) \\le \\text{max_credit}, \\quad \\text{for all semester } t$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### No retaking\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, we don't want to take the same class multiple times, so we have the following constraint to ensure that a class is taken at most once.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum_{t=1}^{T} x[t, c] \\le 1, \\quad \\text{for all class } c$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective \n",
    "\n",
    "A naive objective would be to minimize the sum of $x$: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\min \\sum_{i=t}^{T} \\sum_{c \\in C} x[t, c]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "But this would lead to many equally good solutions. To avoid this, we add a weight $t$ to the class $c$ if its taken at semester $t$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\min \\sum_{i=t}^{T} \\sum_{c \\in C} x[t, c] \\cdot t$$\n",
